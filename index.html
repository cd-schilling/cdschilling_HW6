    <h2>Let Me introduce Myself</h2>
    <p> This is my personal website for BAIS:3300.

        To start, I grew up in northern iowa in a city named Mason City, Iowa. I lived there for 17 years before moving to a neighboring town named Clear Lake. 
        I attended the local community college, NIACC, and later transfered to the University of Iowa studying Business Analytics & Information Systems. I am 22
        years old, I have 2 older sisters (Bailee & Michaela) whom currently live in Clear Lake. 

        After I graduated high school in 2021, I started working for a local gym in Clear Lake. I am very involved with fitness and have been for many years. 
        I started work at the front desk, but I knew I wanted to do more. I developed a fantastic relationship with my boss who let me job-shadow with clients
        and motivated me to get USAW certified (U.S.A Weightlifting) to start training some of his clients on my own.
        
        I gratuated from NIACC in 2023, and I knew I had a passion for data analysis and insight. I transfered to The University of Iowa later that summer and it was hard.
        This was the first time I was living and figuring things out on my own, but I got the hang of it quick. The summer after my first year, I took an Internship back 
        home in Clear Lake at Stellar Industries, a work truck manufacturer based in Garner, IA. There, I learned alot including business processes and data vizualisation.
        After, I went back to Iowa City to work for a property management group, and I have been here for 2 years with hopes to graduate this May with my Bachelor's in BAIS.
