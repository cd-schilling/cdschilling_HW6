    <h2>Let Me Introduce Myself</h2>
    <p>
      This is my personal website for BAIS:3300.
    </p>
    <p>
      To start, I grew up in northern Iowa in a city named Mason City. I lived there for 17 years before moving to a neighboring town called Clear Lake.
      I attended the local community college, NIACC, and later transferred to the University of Iowa to study Business Analytics & Information Systems. I am 22
      years old, and I have two older sisters (Bailee and Michaela) who currently live in Clear Lake.
    </p>

      After I graduated high school in 2021, I started working at a local gym in Clear Lake. I've been very involved in fitness for many years.
      I started at the front desk, but I knew I wanted to do more. I developed a great relationship with my boss, who let me shadow client sessions
      and encouraged me to get USAW certified (U.S.A. Weightlifting) so I could begin training some clients on my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      I graduated from NIACC in 2023, and I realized I had a passion for data analysis and insight. I transferred to the University of Iowa later that summer — and it was hard.
      It was the first time I was living on my own and figuring things out by myself, but I picked it up quickly. The summer after my first year, I took an internship
      back home in Clear Lake at Stellar Industries, a work truck manufacturer based in Garner, IA. There, I learned a lot — including business processes and data visualization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterward, I returned to Iowa City and began working for a property management group. I've been there for two years now, and I hope to graduate this May with my Bachelor's in BAIS.
